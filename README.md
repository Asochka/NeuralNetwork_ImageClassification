# NeuralNetwork_ImageClassification
Task: develop a program that provides classification of a dataset downloaded from some site (kaggle etc). For classification, it is necessary to use a neural network of arbitrary architecture. I use convolutional neural networks as a bonus solution. My dataset contain 3 classes og images(daytime, nighttime, sunrise/sunset).
### Program consist of:
- cleaning and normalization of input data;
- visualization of a dataset using dimensionality reduction methods;
- build a neural network and train it;
- evaluate the classification accuracy of the neural network;
- experiment with several neural network structures;
- train a convolutional or recurrent neural network.
